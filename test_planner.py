import planner

# Code out your tests here. Some sample tests for the first function have already been written.
# Remember to use the dot syntax of "planner.functionName()" when referencing functions from the other file.

print(planner.perfect_day('sunny'))

print(planner.perfect_day('rainy'))

## ^ The tests for the first function `perfect_day` have been written for you, but you'll need to write the rest yourself as you go. 
##   REMEMBER: You need to write one test for each desired outcome, so if there are 5 possible results, you'll need at least five tests to prove that it works.
