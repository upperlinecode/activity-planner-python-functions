## Define your functions here.

## Define a function `perfect_day` that returns the string, “Time for fun in the sun!” if the weather is sunny. If it’s rainy, return the string, “Enjoy a book and some tea indoors.”

def perfect_day(weather):
    return

## There are some days when the weather is not ideal, but we can still get outdoors and make the most of it. Write a function, `outdoor_fun`, that does the following:
## If the weather is cloudy, it should suggest taking a trip to the botanic garden.
## If the weather is windy, it should suggest flying a kite at the park.
## If the weather is sunny, it should suggest going for a bike ride.

## Temperatures tend to fluctuate in your city. Write a function that takes in two arguments: weather, and temperature. Like the previous function, it should recommend an activity based on the weather conditions. Additionally, it should suggest bringing a coat if the temperature is below 50 degrees. If the temperature is below 40 degrees, it should suggest wearing a coat, hat and scarf. If the temperature is above 50 degrees it should only suggest an activity.

## Sometimes you like to spend the day indoors, regardless of the weather. Write a function that takes in two arguments: weather, and indoor or outdoor preference.
## If weather is sunny and preference is outdoors, suggest going for a bike ride.
## If weather is sunny and preference is indoors, suggest working on a jigsaw puzzle.
## If weather is windy and preference is indoors, suggest flying a kite at the park.
## If weather is windy and preference is outdoor, suggesting getting crafty and making a weather vane.
## If weather is cloudy and preference is outdoors, suggest visiting the botanic garden.
## If weather is cloudy and the preference is indoors, suggest cozying up with your favorite book.

## Challenge yourself to add more suggestions based on other weather conditions that we haven't covered yet. If the user enters a weather condition that you don't recognize, return a error.
