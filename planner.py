## Define your functions here.

## 1. Define a function `perfect_day` that returns the string, “Time for fun in the sun!” if the weather is sunny. 
##    If it’s rainy, return the string, “Enjoy a book and some tea indoors.”
##    (This function has two outcomes, so it requires two tests, which have been written already in the `test_planner.py` file)

def perfect_day(weather):
    return

## 2. There are some days when the weather is not ideal, but we can still get outdoors and make the most of it. Write a function, `outdoor_fun`, that does the following:
##    If the weather is cloudy, it should suggest taking a trip to the botanic garden.
##    If the weather is windy, it should suggest flying a kite at the park.
##    If the weather is sunny, it should suggest going for a bike ride.
##    (Requires 3 tests, they haven't been written yet)

## 3. Temperatures tend to fluctuate in your city. Write a function called `temp_check` that takes in two arguments: weather, and temperature. 
##    Like the previous function, it should recommend an activity based on the weather conditions. 
##    Additionally, it should suggest bringing a coat if the temperature is below 50 degrees. 
##    If the temperature is below 40 degrees, it should suggest wearing a coat, hat and scarf. 
##    If the temperature is 50 degrees or higher it should only suggest an activity.
##    (Requires at least 3 tests)

## 4. Sometimes you like to spend the day indoors, regardless of the weather. Write a function called `ultimate_check` that takes in two arguments: weather, and indoor or outdoor preference.
##    If weather is sunny and preference is outdoors, suggest going for a bike ride.
##    If weather is sunny and preference is indoors, suggest working on a jigsaw puzzle.
##    If weather is windy and preference is indoors, suggesting getting crafty and making a weather vane.
##    If weather is windy and preference is outdoor, suggest flying a kite at the park.
##    If weather is cloudy and preference is outdoors, suggest visiting the botanic garden.
##    If weather is cloudy and the preference is indoors, suggest cozying up with your favorite book.
##    (Requires at least 6 tests)

## 5. [STRETCH] Challenge yourself to add more suggestions to the `ultimate_check` function based on other weather conditions that we haven't covered yet. If the user enters a weather condition that you don't recognize, return a error.
